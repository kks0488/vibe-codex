# VCF (VC Finish) Alias

## Purpose

This skill is a thin alias for `vc-phase-loop`.

## Instructions

- Treat any invocation of `vcf` as a direct call to `vc-phase-loop`.
- Read and follow the `vc-phase-loop` skill instructions exactly.
- Do not deviate from vc-phase-loop defaults, execution rules, or completion proof requirements.
